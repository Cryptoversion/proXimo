# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to try to build a crypto portfolio optimizer using the numpy and pandas
packages. It would use monte carlo to simulate millions of portfolios. It would do this
by taking into account volatility, and expected return.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

 I would like to work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

They were all answered during class.
