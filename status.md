Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have written a function which calls the yahoo finance API and imports
the time series data into a pandas dataframe. I have also cleaned and organized the data.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to confirm all the formulas that I need in order 
to calculate the portfolio STDev, returns, covariance matrix etc. I then need to
figure out exactly how the simulation will operate and then finally decide 
how I am going to visualize the results. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far just the normal stuff like syntax errors and researching functions and methods.
